1. open cmd (admin) and navigate to the mongo/server/3.6/bin
2. type mongod ,hit enter
3. open webstorm terminal and type: node app.js

everything should work now and the database is located on localhost with port 27017.

if this does not work, open a second command prompt and navigate to the same bin folder, then instead of running mongod you run mongo (after mongod is running)
